# Accessibility Labs Landing Page
This repository is home to the central landing page for all five of the IUSE Accessibility Labs. This will be the first page visited when going to all.rit.edu and will help direct uses to the lab or case studies they are looking for. This project is part of the National Science Foundations Grant #1825023 for the development of accessibility-focused learning materials for undergraduate students.
